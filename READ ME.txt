Hi, before you start saying that my code sucks and other stuff just note that I learned the basics of python like 3 days ago
so I am definitely not good. I am just posting this because it is my first original "project" (if you can even call it a project)
of course I still may update it to a bigger version so there are like 15 questions. Please tell me if there is a thing I can add.
I love making small projects into bigger things.
